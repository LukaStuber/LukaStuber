## About me ðŸ’»
Currently I am studying **Programming** in **Vienna, Austria**.
\
I have experience with **C#** and **Python**, and very light knowledge of other languages like C/C++, Java, JavaScript.\
\
I speak **German** and **English**.
\
I go by **he/him**

## My Projects ðŸ› 
Right now I'm making **Terminal Games** or random **Tools** I may need from time to time to learn how to develop apps.
\
They probably won't be of any good use, especially in my early phase of programming.

## My future ðŸ’«
Language-wise I hope to soon learn **C** and eventually **C++**. I would also like to learn **Java/TypeScript** and **HTML** to finally make [my own website.](https://spitedev.com)\
\
Job-wise I plan on working as a **Software Engineer** or as a **Backend Developer**.
